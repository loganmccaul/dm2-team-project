	Overview
|------------------------

	The project will take the form of a single-player puzzle game. The object of the game will be 
	to complete three separate puzzles(red,blue,green) acting as a character in a Pac-Man style arcade game. 
	As the player completes the puzzle, they receive a key. When they have 3 keys, they are able 
	to open the final door and try to complete one final puzzle.

	...Puzzles...
	We are still writing the puzzles, but we would like to have each room be a slightly different 
	style of puzzle. For instance, we'll have a red room be like a coordination challenge complete
	with a wall of lava, the blue room will be a race against the clock and then the green room 
	will be a logic test of some sort, to test the players' intellect as well.

	...HTML5 Canvas...
	We will draw the game and the components on an html5 canvas. I thought there might be more to say.

	...Movement...
	One of the key parts of this game is going to be movement. We will need to have a solid engine
	for moving sprites around the board. This will best be accomplished with a JavaScript/jQuery
	code base. The engine should be able to move any object that we render from point a to point
	b in a certain timeframe. Unless the css3 animations would be easier, I think we'd be able to 
	have a little more control in jQuery.

	...Flashlights...
	One twist in the game we came up with was a concept of 'flashlights.' If the background of a 
	room is red, green, or blue, we thought it might be interesting to have three different colors 
	of flashlights to illuminate key parts of the puzzle. You would have to switch the color of 
	the flashlight (moved by the mouse)

		...An alternative...
		An alternative to that would be have three keys on the keyboard switch between all the 
		colors and have the background of each room change to reveal different things on the game 
		board
